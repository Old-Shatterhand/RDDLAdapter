# RDDLAdapter

Adapt the work from Keller et al. (PROST) and Sanner (RiDDLeSim) to a 
deep reinforcement learning tool developed at Saarland University (in process).

For this purpose, I implement a python-scipt to merge the starting of RiDDLeSim 
and Prost in one script executing all together. 

The communication is implemented via "named pipes" according to the scheme of the learner.
